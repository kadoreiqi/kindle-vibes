combine jpg into one pdf (especially for manga downloaded from certain websites)

currently using combinejpg02(batch)
how it works: it creates pdf for each folder containing jpg.
what it solves: kindle only can read pdf (as far as concerned), but the manga(japanese comics) downloaded are folder with jpg. So in order to read the manga in kindle, converter is needed and this python script does for batch processing.

currently also using epub_converter
how it works: it use the ttf file (NotoSan) to convert the words from epub to pdf.
what it solves: online epub converter is not perfect, first of all, kindle is small in general, so the margin is being eliminated to maximize the wordings, secondly, no edge or side being cropped out such that in the online epub converter.
