combine jpg into one pdf (especially for manga downloaded from certain websites)

currently using combinejpg02(batch)
how it works: it creates pdf for each folder containing jpg.
what it solves: kindle only can read pdf (as far as concerned), but the manga(japanese comics) downloaded are folder with jpg. So in order to read the manga in kindle, converter is needed and this python script does for batch processing.
